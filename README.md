# TicTacToe-python

Hey people!!<br />
I coded a game again !!

This entire project is a simple commandline game, that we used to play in the backsheet of our notebooks --> _"**TicTacToe**"_.

So, if you wanna play this game, 
fork my repository, and execute the python script in you **command line**.
